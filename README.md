1.	How do I approach designing software?
My approach in designing this scene was to first understand the sample code. Making small adjustments to understand how it all works helped me understand what I needed to modify to get the result I was looking for. One skill I have developed in this process is understanding how to utilized separate code files by using the #include function. This helped keep the code more organized. This could be helpful in other designs projects by being able to easily reuse the code I have worked with. 
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
By far the most helpful resource in developing this program was understanding the sample code. I finally got to a point where I was not worried if the program would not run because I became comfortable with troubleshooting when errors did occur. By running the code several times, I was able to see how changes affected the code either by causing errors or having different outcomes. Once challenge this project posed was placing the objects in the scene where I expected them. This took many iterations to get correct.  
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
After completing this course work, I feel more confident in my ability to troubleshoot errors in code. I do not see myself working in the field of computational graphics, however the understanding of how things work, can be beneficial. I also feel I gained a stronger knowledge of  how programs run using an organized file system. This is one of the key take-aways I gained from this course.
